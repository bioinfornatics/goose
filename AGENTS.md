# AGENTS Instructions

goose is an AI agent framework in Rust with CLI and Electron desktop interfaces.

## Setup
```bash
source bin/activate-hermit
cargo build
```

## Commands

### Build
```bash
cargo build                   # debug
cargo build --release         # release  
just release-binary           # release + openapi
```

### Test
```bash
cargo test                   # all tests
cargo test -p goose          # specific crate
cargo test --package goose --test mcp_integration_test
just record-mcp-tests        # record MCP
```

### Lint/Format
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

### UI
```bash
just generate-openapi        # after server changes
just run-ui                  # start desktop
cd ui/desktop && pnpm test   # test UI
```

```

## Development Loop
```bash
# 1. source bin/activate-hermit
# 2. Make changes
# 3. cargo fmt
```

### Run these only if the user has asked you to build/test your changes:
```
# 1. cargo build
# 2. cargo test -p <crate>
# 3. cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
# 4. [if server] just generate-openapi
```

## Rules

- Test: Prefer tests/ folder, e.g. crates/goose/tests/
- Test: When adding features, update goose-self-test.yaml, rebuild, then run `goose run --recipe goose-self-test.yaml` to validate
- Error: Use anyhow::Result
- Provider: Implement Provider trait see providers/base.rs
- MCP: Extensions in crates/goose-mcp/
- Server: Changes need just generate-openapi

## Code Quality

- Comments: Write self-documenting code - prefer clear names over comments
- Comments: Never add comments that restate what code does
- Comments: Only comment for complex algorithms, non-obvious business logic, or "why" not "what"
- Simplicity: Don't make things optional that don't need to be - the compiler will enforce
- Simplicity: Booleans should default to false, not be optional
- Errors: Don't add error context that doesn't add useful information (e.g., `.context("Failed to X")` when error already says it failed)
- Simplicity: Avoid overly defensive code - trust Rust's type system
- Logging: Clean up existing logs, don't add more unless for errors or security events

## Ink / Terminal UI (ui/text)

- Ink renders React to a fixed character grid — not a browser. Content that exceeds a Box's dimensions is NOT clipped; it visually overflows into neighboring cells and breaks the layout.

- Ink-Text: Never use `wrap="wrap"` inside a fixed-height Box — wrapped text can exceed the Box height and bleed into adjacent components. Use `wrap="truncate"` and pre-truncate the string to fit the available character budget (lines × width).
  
- Ink-Layout: When changing card/cell dimensions, always recalculate how much content fits. Account for borders (2 chars), padding, margins, and sibling elements when computing the
remaining space for dynamic text.
  
- Ink-Overflow: Ink has no `overflow: hidden`. The only way to prevent overflow is to ensure content never exceeds the container size — truncate text, limit list items, or cap height.
  
- Ink-FlexGrow: Avoid `flexGrow={1}` on text containers inside fixed-height cards — the text will try to fill available space but Ink won't clip it if it exceeds the boundary.
  
- Ink-HeightBudget: When computing how many rows/items fit vertically, count EVERY line used by headers, footers, margins, borders, and scroll indicators. Under-reserving vertical space (e.g., `height - 8` when chrome actually uses 16 lines) causes Ink to squeeze out margins between items, making borders collapse. Always audit the actual line count.
  
- Ink-TrailingMargin: Don't apply `marginBottom` to the last item in a list — it wastes a line and can push content out of the container. Use conditional margins or container `gap`.

## Never

- Never: Edit ui/desktop/openapi.json manually
- Cargo.toml: For human-authored dependency changes, use `cargo add` instead of manually editing dependency entries unless there is a specific reason not to.
- Cargo.toml: Automated dependency bump PRs are exempt; when manual edits are necessary, keep `Cargo.lock` consistent.
- Never: Skip cargo fmt
- Never: Merge without running clippy
- Never: Comment self-evident operations (`// Initialize`, `// Return result`), getters/setters, constructors, or standard Rust idioms

## Entry Points
- CLI: crates/goose-cli/src/main.rs
- Server: crates/goose-server/src/main.rs
- UI: ui/desktop/src/main.ts
- Agent: crates/goose/src/agents/agent.rs

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
